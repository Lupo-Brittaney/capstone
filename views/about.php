            <p>Hi! I am Brittaney and I love the beauty of Colorado! It is such a blessing to be able to hike and explore all around this amazing state. </p>
            <p>In the summer I bring my kids along with me. We try to visit a new hiking spot every week. There are favorites we return to but we all enjoy seeing new things.</p>
            <p>No matter when or where I go I have a camera in hand to capture the majesty all around. I hope you enjoy the hike pictures I am sharing with you on this site!</p>
            <p>PS- This image is at the Manitou Incline just outside of Colorado Springs. If you've never gone you have got to go! It kicked my butt and was amazing all at once!</p>
